TLDR EDIT - blew my hand up 5 years ago and it put my ass in check. my wife is my personal super hero. Don't let something catastrophic happen to you so you take initiative for the direction of your life. 


MAJOR EDIT - I feel this should be said again since my post has been reported. This happened 5 years ago and I am 100 percent healthy. This post is to simply remind people not to do DUMBASS SHIT LIKE I DID! 

First hospital visit after being cleaned up. https://imgur.com/a/lGH9lUU

What's up everyone, so for those in the states, we are celebrating the Fourth of July, and I hope my story can remind you to be safe during your celebrations and not to take anything for granted in your life.

So 5 years ago , I fucked up by blowing up my hand with a firework - a double shot mortar to be exact, and it was one of the best things that happened to me. 

 For a background, I grew up on 300 acres of land and spent my childhood and teenage years riding quads, dirtbikes, 4x4ing, and having paintball wars with friends. We also enjoyed blowing shit up and always looked forward to the 4th of July and the loot we could score when it came to fireworks. I always felt confident handling them or the chemical compounds needed to make a big boom. I had a few close calls but nothing that ever shook me. Shit, did that change.

Fast forward/Rewind to 2016 at the age of 27. At the time I worked for corporation making OK money with room to grow,  and just being complacent where I was in my life as far as meaningful goals and my futire went. I had also just began dating my wife in February of 2016 and things were wonderful 5 months into our relationship and I knew she was ""the one"". We live in California and her cousin has a house by the beach and would have Fourth of July parties every year, and this would also be my first time hanging out with her family too. 

We showed up earlier in the afternoon ready to have fun. Come night time myself and future brother in law were the first ones to break out the fireworks. It was toward the end of the night when we were down to our last few set of mortars. My wife and sister in law were inside cleaning and we were about to get ready to go home since we both had work the next day.

One of my favorite things to do with mortars was to hold the tube like a rocket launcher and pretend I was that big dude from resident evil. Long story short, I dropped the mortar in backwards in a tube that was too hot. Having set off god knows how many fireworks, cakes, mortars and m1000s, i knew something was wrong when it prematurely went off.

""DROP IT! DROP IT! DROP IT!"", my brother in law yelled. Even he knew shit wasn't right. Dropping this tube launching fireballs hundreds of feet in the air was NOT an option. Any direction there was either a set of houses or bystanders around.  Before I could react, I was blinded by a huge flash, ringing in my ears and the strong smell of burnt hair and flesh. All I could hear were muffled voices as I paced to gather my thoughts and I kept telling everyone, ""I'm good, I'm good!""

As I walked around, all I could feel was ""warm"", as if I submerged my entire arm in warm water. I looked down to see my hand and my thought was, ""oh, that's not good."" I calmly walked into the house where my wife and sister in law are still cleaning and I make my way to the sink where I turned on the cold water and run my hand underneath it and attempt to move my fingers. I thought to myself, ""ok I can feel cold water, my fingers are sort of moving I think, I'm good."" With the help of a neighbor, I get a beach towel and someone's phone charger to strap my arm up.  I calmly tell everyone i am okay, I'm good, take me to the hospital. I knew i had to keep calm and needed to get help asap or my ass was going to bleed out.

Without boring you all with too much detail, the first hospital we went to looked at the blast wound and said ""you need to go to a trauma center, we can't do anything for that here."" I was stabilized for 4 hours until 2:30am and was transported via ambulance to a trauma center 30 miles or so away.

Upon arriving to a well known and respected trauma center and waiting another 2 hours before speaking to a surgeon, he told me ""dude, you need a plastic surgeon and specialist. You are lucky you're a big guy or that arm would be gone. We are going to try to get you into (names 2 top hospitals here in California) but it looks like they're full, but we have 1 shot at XYZ. ""

I get life flighted and arrive to a large University hospital where I had a total of 3 surgeries and 1 skin graft surgeries that included 8 pins that went in from my knuckles to my wrist. Basically all my metacarpals and wrist was shattered from the blast.  After I was in the hospital for 5 days, I needed weekly visits to my surgical team 2x a week for 6 weeks...which was 2 1/2 hours each way from where my wife and I lived. I ended up losing my position at work and on top of that, i could not find any physical therapist who would accept my disability insurance so I can begin my rehab. It was a total shit show dealing with insurance, doctors who took over my case, and my previous employer who still hadn't paid me out from my vacation and other PTO I acquired.

 When it was all said and done, the real hero of this was my wife. 5 months into our relationship and we were dealt the biggest test. She assisted me with showering, shaving, cutting my hair, dressing, and getting me to my weekly doctor appointments.. By the grace of God, my medical team, and with the support of both our families, I kept my hand and about 95% of functionality. This was the most humbling and eye opening experience that has happened to me. It FORCED me to grow as a man and put my life into perspective. In 2018, I  enrolled in pre requisite classes to begin taking steps toward completing a degree as an Occupational Therapy Assistant and just graduated this year in March. I hope to use my experience to help others in hard times and let them know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel - it just requires diligence, hard work, and belief. No matter how bad is, don't give it!

odrno2,False,"When I was younger I worked as a engineer for a small company. The owner who I'll call Jake, let me know before I started that I would be doing about 10 hour days, 6 days a week for about 6 months, but that I would have to be flexible. Some days they wouldn't have work for me and other days I'd be expected to stay a few hours late. This didn't bother me too much as I wasn't too tight for money and I didn't mind staying behind a few extra hours occasionally.  

I got to work and was told to follow instructions from the owners brother, Steve. He was an arrogant character, who always thought he knew how to do everyone's else's job better than them. We butted heads a few times but nothing major. 

A few months in, I found a new job starting in a week that paid better. Later on that day I had another disagreement with Steve. The situation was petty but it's his response that really confused me. It ended with him screaming in my face ""if you don't do as I say, then you can fucking leave!"". 

So I packed my stuff and left. Steve was a little confused, thinking I'd just fall in line. He was too arrogant to apologise, and I had a job lined up. 

(Side note for people not in the UK, I was working a zero hour contract. This means I get an hourly wage but I'm not afforded some labor rights like a set salery, minimum work hours or notice for dismissal. This works both ways though so I can leave the job whenever I want with no notice.) 

I decided to call up Jake since he'd always been chill and told him what happened. He told me he needed me and I should just return to work. I told him unless he controls steve and made him apologise, there was no way I was coming back. He refused so I told him I'll send in my final time sheet.

Two weeks later and I've started my new job. I still haven't been paid for my final week, so I call Jake. He told me that ""since you didn't give notice for leaving, you owe me for lost product of work."" He said if I didn't like it, I should sue him and ""recommended"" I should just take the loss and move on. This was complete bs.

A couple months go by until I finally find time to file for small claims court. Few days after sending him notice, Jake paid my money including court fees and extra. He actually called me up apologizing for the ""confusion"". He wanted to know when I could return to work. I'd heard from one of my ex co-workers that because of the infrequent hours, people would leave as soon as they were told they wouldn't have work the next day. Others would leave when they realised how much of a jerk Steve was. They'd gone through about 7 different workers in the time I was gone and struggled to keep anyone for more than a week. I told him I'd think about it. I managed to string him along for a few weeks before he stopped calling me.

The moral of the story is that if you think you're being treated unfairly, you shouldn't just put up with it. Your self respect isn't worth compromising. Don't settle for being treated like shit, especially when you're willing to go above and beyond for them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/odrno2/boss_told_me_if_you_dont_like_it_then_leave/,"Boss told me ""if you don't like it, then leave""",r/MaliciousCompliance,1625428171.0,True,False

odsded,False,"**tl;dr:** I found around **79M** can kicked shares in Jan 2021 using the married put approach.  We can see those cans kicked out 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months from Jan 2021 at various options expirations.

After poking around in ToS, I found that I can see exactly when Puts where opened by tracking the daily Open Interest for a put.  See my previous post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ocen11/historical\_gme\_71421\_options\_oi\_to\_see\_how\_many/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ocen11/historical_gme_71421_options_oi_to_see_how_many/)

I needed the data in CSV format so I could play with it.  So I bought the GME Options Data (surprisingly cheap, about $21) from [https://www.historicaloptiondata.com/](https://www.historicaloptiondata.com/) for 2021 up to end of June.

I then filtered out the lowest strike Put option for each of the major options expirations (Feb, March, April, Jan 2022 leap, and Jan 2023 leap) during that time and charted the daily Open Interest Change.

[Daily OI Change for Lowest Strike Puts](https://preview.redd.it/mfk5o6z1r8971.png?width=1097&format=png&auto=webp&s=26b7024d5072bbb0683b9d9c1a3d34e596ddfa4e)

Guess what?  Most of these low strike puts were opened around GME's Jan run up!

*Wut mean?*  Superstonk has been discussing how married puts are used to hide naked shorts in deep OTM puts so this data shows us exactly how far out they kicked those Jan naked short cans down the road AND we can see which expirations have them.  We can see pretty much every major options expiration has a ton of new openings in Jan so those cans were kicked 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months out (Feb ,March, April, July, Jan 2022, and Jan 2023, respectively).

|*Option*|*As of 1/4/2021*|*As of 2/1/2021*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Feb $1 Put|0|52,193|
|March|0 (n/a)|32,907|
|April $0.50 Put|510|43,892|
|July $0.50 Put|168|71,709|
|Jan 2022 $0.50 Put|2,441|106,082|
|Jan 2023 $2 Put|105|16,585|
|**Total**|3,224|**323,368**|

*Do you see what I see?*  There's about 320,000 options opened in Jan 2021 to hide naked shorts and kick those cans *just at the cheapest strike!*  That's the equivalent of **32,000,000 (32M) shares**!

*Wut about other low strikes?*  I filtered the options data for two snapshots in time: Jan 4, 2021 (before can kicking) and Feb 1, 2021 (after can kicking).  Out of those snapshots, I summed the total open interest for all options with a strike price less than or equal to $20.  Here's the results:

||1/4/2021|2/1/2021|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Total Put OI for all strikes <= $20|309,563|1,101,826|

The difference there is **792,263 OI**.  Basically just shy of 800k new put open interest at super low OTM strikes representing over **79M** shares kicked down the road in Jan 2021!  Half of those are hidden in the lowest strike alone.

**Happy July 4th!  We're gonna have a blast!**

odsgs7,False,"There are legal arguments allowing “In God we trust” to be on U.S. currency and posted in court rooms as long as religious establishments are treated equally, but what about the people that do not believe a society should “trust” God? And what are we trusting God to do?

Would theists accept ""We don't trust or believe in a God"" on currency?

I don’t know what extent a judicial court decision is based on religious argument or influenced by religious convictions, but I for sure don’t want to see “In God we trust” written on the wall behind the Judge.

I also don’t see any need for anyone to say “Under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance.

A survey of about 1,000 college students across the U.S. found that nearly half would like to see the motto “In God We Trust” removed from American currency, highlighting a trend of declining religiosity among younger generations.

“Do you believe the motto ‘In God We Trust’ should remain on U.S. currency or should it be removed?” asked the online [poll](https://www.thecollegefix.com/nearly-half-of-college-students-believe-in-god-we-trust-should-be-removed-from-u-s-currency-poll/), conducted for *The College Fix* by College Pulse. 53 percent of respondents said the phrase should remain and 45 percent said it should be taken off.

69 percent of black students, 57 percent of Asian students, 51 percent of white students, and exactly half of Hispanic or Latino students supported keeping the phrase.

69 percent of LGBT students said they would support removing the motto from U.S. currency, while only 38 percent of students who identify as straight said they would support doing so.

67 percent of student Democrats said they’d favor removing the phrase, compared to just 6 percent of student Republicans.",https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/odsgs7/its_past_time_to_remove_in_god_we_trust_from/,Its past time to remove IN GOD WE TRUST from currency and in courts.,r/atheism,1625430827.0,True,False

odpw2z,False,"At the start of this year my friend Toby (M21) asked if I (F21) would be willing to sit for a painting he was doing which would be submitted to an art exhibition at his University. I agreed to this and sat for 2 sessions. He asked me to sit in a simple pose, just slightly slouched in an armchair and this all went fine. Once the sessions were over I asked if I could see the painting and he told me he had more work to do on it and didn't want anyone to see it before it was completed. I was disappointed but agreed and thought nothing more of it.

Cut to last month and I was at dinner with a few of my friends, including Toby and another girl who goes to uni with him Becca (F21), it came up in conversation that the art exhibition was going ahead and Toby had two pieces being shown. I was excited and hoped that the painting he did of me would be there as I wanted to see it. I asked about attending and Toby immediately jumped in and said it was for University students only and that he would show me the painting once the exhibition was over. Once the dinner was over Becca stopped behind to talk to me and said that she was confused as to why Toby told me it was for University students only when it was open to everyone. I was really confused myself and decided to go along without informing Toby I was going to be there.

The exhibition comes around and I attended. I walked around and found Toby's work, including the painting of me. However it wasn't what I expected, in the painting I was completely naked, it was very clearly my face on a naked body. I felt violated, even though I knew it wasn't my naked body and just a drawing he did I felt sick. He never informed me that it would be a nude painting, I would not have agreed to my face being put on a naked body. I saw red and stormed around the exhibition until I saw Toby and I immediately started shouting at him about how violating the painting was and how I was so upset he did this without informing me. Unfortunately his teacher was nearby and heard everything. I stormed out in tears. He's since text me several times telling me I'm a selfish bitch for making him look bad in front of his teacher and I've had messages from several of our mutual friends telling me I overreacted and its just a painting.

So AITA for making him look bad in front of his teacher by screaming at him during his art exhibition?

Edit: I just spoke to a mutual friend of ours (not one of the people that has text me defending him) he spoke to Toby and asked about the painting and Toby admitted that its how he imagines I look like naked but he didn't see an issue with it because its not like its really my body. Now I feel even more violated. I will be contacting the university tomorrow morning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/odpw2z/aita_for_screaming_at_my_friend_in_front_of_his/,AITA for screaming at my friend in front of his teacher during his university art exhibition?,r/AmItheAsshole,1625422483.0,True,False

odwjpq,False,"I was just recently reminded of this whilst trying to explain to someone how messed up Ontario is.

Did everyone collectively forget that Doug Ford and Co. blew all this money his brilliant idea of bracelet's that would beep if we got too close? It was spearheaded by ""Facedrive Inc"". I know that this is a pretty minor thing after all is said and done following this pandemic, but this one was just nonsense. If I remember, it was basically a scam in every regard. I recall a couple Reddit threads and news articles that dug into the entire thing and most of the parties involved were basically...well, nobody. Almost no solid business, technological or public health background involved. It was like the entire thing was conceived by a couple of high school kids after smoking some of Doug Ford's bowling alley hash. Dude, what if we like, invented bracelets that beeped if people got too close?

So then they gave people with no real business credentials a few million dollars to develop this shit and obviously nothing came out of it beyond the announcement. So what gives? Why has nobody questioned this? Or sued? Or brought it up in the House? Again, 2+ million isn't a lot of money when you're talking about a government budget but...still? Nobody in the media really brought it up, no lawsuits were filed and - as typical of Ontarians - we just seemingly brushed it under the rug and complained about haircuts and gyms instead. Is this just something we're supposed to forget?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/odwjpq/did_we_all_just_forget_about_doug_fords_25/,Did we all just forget about Doug Ford's 2.5+ million dollar beeping bracelet scam?,r/ontario,1625445650.0,True,False

and also taught part time at my old dance studio. Through a production I was part of I met this guy who was pretty well known in the dance circles. I thought he was ok at first but he started acting weirder every time I saw him. Then when we were at a party he got me alone and sexually assaulted me. 

I was too scared to report him. I later found out I was pregnant. I kept hoping that the baby was my husband’s but we had been using condoms until I found a better birth control for myself. 

We went to counseling right away and I realized that I emotionally could not go through with an abortion. My husband said he would love me regardless and that he would be betraying his marriage vows if he didn’t support me or the baby, who didn’t choose who its father was. 

I gave birth and I instantly loved my son. And for a while we felt like we could put the traumas of the past behind us. 

But it was sad because the fact our son was biracial in appearance made it clear it wasn’t my husband’s child and his family were very upset about that.

When his grandpa was dying he wrote letters to each of his family, including the newborn grandchildren that were born after our son, for them to open one day but didn’t write one to our son. He was the only kid who didn’t get one.

As our son started growing into toddlerhood I would catch my husband flinching away when our son held his gaze. My husband has progressively had a harder time looking him in the eyes. 

He began tiptoeing around our son and saying that he was busy when our son tried to get his attention. He’s also begun withdrawing from me and snapping at me when I suggested updating our photo album. 

We’ve been in therapy every week for the past year and he never wants to talk about his feelings. He says he’s rather just work through my own feelings. 

Finally he said to me one day very bitterly that our son looks like the spitting image of his father. He says that he sees flashes of me in our son when he laughs but that he can’t stand having to look at the face of “ that man” before he can catch the resemblance between mother and son.

He then stormed off .

He apologized during our next therapy session but then read me a letter he wrote me saying he fantasizes about asking me if I’ll allow him to love me and our son from afar. 

He says he regrets not saying this years before but every time he sees our son he feels nothing but pain and anger and helplessness. 

He said he doesn’t know if he can keep hiding his uneasiness around our son.

In subsequent therapy sessions he said that he felt he was a fraud of a father father but can’t help how he feels. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like he’s trying to beg me to let him go or something. 

We’ve barely been physically affectionate for the greater part of two years. I always initiate and he makes excuses. My son is always happy to see his father but I don’t know how much longer he’ll be blind to his dad’s discomfort around him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/odx4es/my_27f_son_5m_was_conceived_due_to_sexual_assault/,My (27F) son (5M) was conceived due to sexual assault.

odreig,False,"This sounds silly as hell but she just bit my head off, I didn't think I was being an asshole but she sure seems to.

I have a cousin (45F) who is a little flakey and has always had an affinity for overcomplicated spellings of normal names. If you know the type you know what I'm talking about. Giving their kids names like Stefanee, Mykaighlah, Khai-leigh...stuff like that. Whatever to each their own, doesn't affect me, I've never said boo about what she named her kids and always done my best to spell them correctly on birthday cards. 

A couple hours ago she hit me up on Messenger to show me pics of her new dog. Great, right? Dog is cute and I tell her as much. Then she drops the name on me...pronounced ""Cody/Kody"". Oh, but of course it isn't spelled that way, she had to put her twist on it to make it special. She is spelling it ""Chode"". Yup. I might be 42 now but I was once a potty-brained teenager and I know what a chode is. After I got my laughter under control I messaged her back and told her to look up chode on Urban Dictionary. While waiting for her reply I checked her Facebook page and sure enough she'd already posted the dog's pics with her chosen name. It had a healthy amount of laugh-reacts but nobody had commented yet. I sent her screenshots of some of the funnier Urban Dictionary definitions. She flipped out and sent me a few nasty messages about how immature I am.

I guess I could have been more ""mature"" about it but c'mon, she named her dog chode! I didn't think it was that serious, she's only had the dog 2 days now so it's not like he knows his name and she's usually the type to laugh at a dirty joke but not this time I guess. So do I owe her an apology? Or should I just laugh it off and wait for her to cool down?

odszxw,False,"I've been with my BF ""alex"" for two years. I get along ok with his mom ""Jane"" sometimes she is a bit of a JustNoMIL. Anyway she got married recently and they wanted a smaller more laid back wedding, because she did the traditional wedding the first time. They got married at a vineyard and it was really nice. For dinner there was fancy brick oven pizza and salad and later there was a mac and cheese bar. Dessert was caramel brownie cheesecake or berry cobblers (I hate cobbler) You probably caught on that there was a lot of cheese. There were also charcuterie boards, so a whole fuck ton of cheese.

Don't get me wrong, I like non-traditional weddings and the food was out of this world, but after dessert I was on the verge of shitting myself. I went to the bathroom, feeling like I was going to die, and it wasn't pretty. The grooms two daughter (late teens and early twenties) were in there. They are both horrible, they have talked so much shit about Jane, and are just mean girls. When i came out they were both snickering and looking at me. I was mortified.

I ended up in there again, because holy hell that woman likes cheese. Later I went over to where she was sitting with her new husband and Jane asked if I was having fun. i said it was beautiful, but admitted I'd been in agony because of her menu, and she really should have had some more balanced options, because a lot of people are dairy sensitive. I then told the groom about what happened with his daughters. He just looked at me weird and then said it was his wedding night and he doesn't want to hear an account of anyone shitting.

My BF got annoyed and said I should have just lied, because you don't complain to the couple at the wedding, but I feel like she should know for future parties, and he should know so he can talk to his daughters. Jane is on her honeymoon, so I don't know if she is mad. She didn't seem it, but a couple of y friends said I am the asshole and it isn't Jane's problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/odszxw/aita_for_being_honest_with_my_boyfriends_mom_when/,AITA for being honest with my boyfriend's mom when she asked if I was enjoying her wedding?,r/AmItheAsshole,1625432558.0,True,False

FAQ: To generate this data, I'm capturing current prices in Euros at https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie and converting to USD. Today's EUR -> USD conversion ratio is 1.1865. I created a simple C# application that assists me in scraping this data and updates the post automatically.

I've had many people reach out to offer help or support with the extended session. Since the most time-consuming (and demanding) part is fetching data and updating the post, I automated it and have tuned my update tool to work for the extended session. As such, once I have it running I should have no trouble taking a break. Thank you to all who offered help and encouragement - I really appreciate it!

Many among the Diamantenhände community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler. I also am worried, as I have tried to make contact many times and haven't received a direct response. Last weekend, DerGurkenraspler deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the originator of the series. I've been serving as guest-host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.

odxzi3,False,"You should know that your gut health can have a direct impact on your mental health as well as your physical health. 

Why YSK: Poor digestion, undiagnosed/discovered food allergies or sensitivities, and a multitude of other issues in your stomach have been linked with depression, anxiety, OCD/BPD like symptoms and more. It can affect your mood, your sleep and your nutrient absorption rate. 

Basically, if you aren't feeling right, check your gut. Stay up on probiotics, and keep an eye on anything you may have a sensitivity to, such as gluten, shellfish, nuts, overly processed foods, etc.

As a personal example, I recently discovered that I have a gluten sensitivity. I suffered from anxiety and awful intrusive thoughts for years, and after going gluten free, almost all of my symptoms have entirely disappeared.

My interest for hobbies returned, I get the ""tingly"" excitement for things again, and life seems a lot more colorful. I wish I'd known this years ago.

I'm definitely not saying it's a cure all for every scenario, but it might help you if you're in a place where you're emotionally unwell for seemingly no reason.

odxqmm,False,"To mark the shotgun nerf I’ve decided to look back at some of the most interesting things I’ve heard from shotgun Apes on crucible.

“ you should use a real weapon, stick to QuickPlay” - shotgun ape that was on my comp team and had 3 kills while I got 12 smg kills

“ WHY DO YOU KEEP SNIPING. NO SKILL”- shotgun ape who kept running right at me and getting sniped


“ STOP USING A FUSION RIFLE BITCH” - shotgun ape who kept running right at me and getting fusion rifled

“ you’re a floaty bitch with no skill, deadman’s with GL is so cheap” - shotgun ape after he could not jump high enough to shotgun my warlock friend out of the sky

“ Shotguns take way more skill than snipers bro, it’s about closing the gap”-my friend, whose only 2 moves in destiny are : shotgun and run away


“ what’s the problem bro, movement IS the skill gap” - me, after my friend complained about me running stompees and a shotgun with felwinters for 99 1V1’s straight 


“ stop being toxic”- shotgun ape I teabagged exactly 1 time after he bagged for a whole round


In conclusion, I’m glad shotguns are getting nerfed. And if your strategy is running straight at someone with no other plan than shotgunning. You have zero right to complain if you get clapped🤣

(Edit :Thnx for platinum
( edit to the edit : take your hurt feelings and go 
home)

 Edit 3 : Also I see a lot of people downvoting pro shotgun posts to oblivion, don’t do that, it’s difficult for people to see outside of themselves so you should do your best to at least hear them out. If they stupid af feel free to downvote tho

Edit 4 : soooo many people calling these quotes made up ( honestly it’s exactly 3 people but still) bro these quotes wouldn’t bother you unless they hurt you, so please deal with that yourself, all I did was make a Reddit post😭",https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/odxqmm/things_shotgun_players_have_said_to_me/,Things shotgun players have said to me,r/DestinyTheGame,1625450790.0,True,False

oe0fce,True,"This is the story about a concerning medical issue related to playing Escape From Tarkov. I hope you read and pay close attention so that you don't end up like me, wishing I had never bought this game.

So, like many of you I was excited for the new wipe and hit the ground running right when it dropped. I heard about the new systems and thought it was a bit strange that there were no patch notes. I had a lot of fun the first few days of the wipe and saw some buzz on the subreddit about the new ""Scav Karma"" system.

Now, I had already killed a few friendly scavs before I knew about the system and saw that it had dropped my reputation with Fence. Figuring I may as well continue on with my scav killing ways I did not immediately repent and watched as my rep dropped further and further. I was having fun tricking other player scavs with the old ""Wiggle-then-Shoot"" maneuver and stealing their loot before making out like a bandit. It was so much fun that I barely stopped playing until a few days into the wipe. I had barely slept, eaten, or showered for the first 72 hours and I needed a break for a bit.

I woke the next morning in bed with my girlfriend and she, having been neglected by me for a few days, wanted to fool around. Unfortunately, my...ahem...member was not up to perform on this given morning, which I chocked up to frayed nerves from days of playing Tarkov. But the problem didn't go away later in the day and I was concerned. I had a scheduled doctor's appointment the next day and decided to bring up my issue with my physician. He asked me if I had any stress lately and I explained that I had been playing this game that was really stressful and before I could tell him the name of the game, he stopped me by asking if it was ""Escape from Tarkov"". I was surprised he had heard of it and he informed me he hadn't until the last few days. Many other young men had come to him lately for similar issues related to this game, and what he told me was very disturbing, to say the least.

You see, unbeknownst to me, included in this update there was a caveat addended to the scav karma system. Not only does your first scav-on-scav murder in any given raid decrease your Fence rep by -0.02 but it also results in a 2% decrease in the total volume of male genitalia. With each ill-gotten scav package, your own package will shrink correspondingly. I was in disbelief! How could Nikita do this to me?!

My doctor gave me a pamphlet with some resources to help me live with my new micropenis, and I've been in shock ever since. I haven't told my girlfriend yet, but I'm concerned she'll leave me when she finds out that I'm a dirty scav-killer, and the anxiety is eating me up inside. My doctor advised that I stop playing Tarkov entirely in order to preserve what I have left of my shriveled manhood and when I asked him if there was any hope of recovering what was lost, he informed me that the changes were permanent.

I'm writing this now in the hopes that some of you out there will take note and stop now, before you end up like me. Learn from my error and don't make the same mistakes I did, or you will regret it...",https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/oe0fce/doctor_advised_me_to_stop_playing_tarkov/,Doctor advised me to stop playing Tarkov,r/EscapefromTarkov,1625462298.0,True,False

odyvla,False,"Hello! Throwaway because I don't want this on my main.

I (f28) own two dogs and recently started a fully remote job which gives me a lot of flexibility.


I used to walk my dogs late at night in a park near my house but now I have a lot more free time I've changed this to two daily walks at 11 am and 4pm.


This went well for about 2 weeks but yesterday two angry woman approached me and asked me to stop walking my dogs during the day because they couldn't take their kids to the park and with online school and all, their kids needed to get out and play in the park.


I told them this was a public space, my dogs were always on a leash and are highly trained (i explained how they used to be SAR dogs until they got injured so I adopted them) so it was not a problem if they wanted to take their kids out at the same time.


They kept complaining and saying that they didn't feel comfortable with me (a short young woman) controlling two big and dangerous dogs around their kids and I should just keep the daylight hours free for their kids as they should have a priority and I was a *insert terrible names here* for not accommodating.


I put my foot down and told them I wouldn't change my schedule as I think my dogs as are important as their kids, then I just walked away because they were calling me names and I got tired of listen to their whining.

oe0wuk,False,"This was over 20 years ago but I was reminded of it today and thought it would be appreciated here.

When I was 16 I got my driver's license and a job delivering the news paper. I had about 225 papers per day and 300 on Sundays. The pay was decent for a kid and it only took about 2 hours to finish my deliveries.

It was great in the summer. Then school started and it got really hard. I was sleeping in class and making mistakes. I had to wake up at 4am to deliver and going to bed early meant I had a serious case of FOMO because my friends hung out until 8 or 9 everyday.

So I asked my boss if I could get out of my 6 month contract. He was super cool up until this point and I honestly thought he'd let me slide as long as he had a replacement. I was wrong. He treated me like a villain and gave me the whole speach about honoring our commitments and how I need to learn respect for myself and if I backed out of the contract then he'd come after me for a bunch of money in fees and penalties.

Whatever. I only had two months left in my contract. My mom was super cool and would drive my route for me sometimes and I went to bed earlier.

About two weeks after the contract discussion with my boss he stopped by my house to tell me about some changes with my route. He says, ""yeah it'll be so great for the customer because instead of 6am they'll get their paper by 5am so you should see an increase in happy customers. Oh and you'll be getting a small raise because from now on the paper won't be delivered to your house on a pallet. Instead you'll drive down to (a town 15 minutes away) and get your papers between 1:30am and 2:15am.""

I mean he pitched this to me like it was the greatest news ever. I reminded him that I'm in high school and I can't be waking up at 1am and I told him there's no way this is better for me. He kind of blew off my concerns and I said, "" Don, my contract says that the papers will be delivered to my house no later than 4am and that it is my responsibility to deliver them by 6am. That is what I agreed to and that is what I will do until my contract is up"".

He again blew me off and said, ""oh yeah yeah yeah no big deal we'll get you a new contract with the changes but the end date will be your original end date so it's all good"".

I admit that I was not a super clever kid but I began to see my out. I said I wasn't going to sign a new contract and that I'd recently been taught that it's important to honor the deals we make and how important it was that I follow through with my commitments.

He could hear the sarcasm dripping off my words and he thought he could power trip me into compliance. He got mad and threatened to fire me if I don't sign a new contract. I actually laughed at him and said that'd be great. I was a bit of a little shit to him at this point and I told him if the papers showed up to my driveway before 4am then I'd deliver them but if not then I'll consider it a breach of contract and I'd have to terminate my relationship with the news paper.

I was in a great mood and had no problems at all. It was actually my mom who was furious that they'd pull these changes on a high school kid trying to make an honest buck. I was just glad to never deliver another paper.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/oe0wuk/forced_to_honor_contract_and_then_asked_to_sign_a/,Forced to honor contract and then asked to sign a new one,r/MaliciousCompliance,1625464499.0,True,False

So Keep Calm and Hodl On!!!

Now for the term widely thrown around that may not be widely understood… the infamous MOASS…

Mother Of All Short Squeezes… that is what it stands for and there is a current reigning champion we must defeat to claim this title officially.

Some of you may know and some may not but in 2008 Porsche was buying heavy amounts of Volkswagen stock… when news broke that they owned over 30% of the company some shorts started sweating… when it was revealed they owned 74% of the company shorts covered their positions which resulted in the current and still reigning MOASS… 

Let me pause here and help anyone out that doesn’t understand what shorting is… if you don’t know what [a short position is](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) read the previous link… if you are more interested in a deep dive and easy to understand explanation of shorting please feel free to read [my previous DD on what shorting is and how it works… this also covers a selling strategy during a short squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/mp99p1/what_are_we_doing_here_real_must_read_dd_study_of/)

Now that everyone is 100% on the same page let’s continue…

By comparison 🦍‘s own over 80% of AMC! Heddgies are just still riding their positions thinking they can break us… shorts knew one company owning 74% meant they were screwed… for some reason they still think we aren’t as powerful as we are… they are relying on FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) and other meme stock to cause us to sell and move on…. They truly don’t understand 💎🙌🏻…

If you truly don’t understand diamond hands I cover in my previous DD I linked but in short… true 💎🙌🏻 is not hodling while losing money… it’s staring at $1000 per share and still saying no I want more!!! I won’t sell for this price!

Back to what we must achieve… 

[Here is a Reuters article from when Volkswagen happened in 2008](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSTRE49R3I920081028) reading it will help you see where I am pulling some of this info from…

The share price in one day skyrocketed to $1005 euro ($1,258.86 USD)

You [can check my math here](https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/bank-of-england-spot/historical-spot-exchange-rates/eur/EUR-to-USD-2008?back=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsearch%3Fclient%3Dsafari%26as_qdr%3Dall%26as_occt%3Dany%26safe%3Dactive%26as_q%3DIn+October+2008+what+was+the+euro+to+dollar+conversion+rate%26channel%3Daplab%26source%3Da-app1%26hl%3Den) the conversation was made with euro to usd price on the exact day it occurred in 2008.

So… is that what it would take to win the title of MOASS you ask? A share price over $1,259 USD… well technically yes if that is what you think made the Volkswagen squeeze infamous… but it isn’t!!!

What made this the MOASS was winning the title, for one day only as the most valuable company in the world. When the price shot up to the tippy top Volkswagen gained the title by being worth $370 billion USD unseating then champion Exxon Mobile by 27 billion dollars. A full 7.297% higher.

So for us to become the new MOASS we must beat out Apple’s market cap of a whopping 2.34 TRILLION dollar market cap!!! Now Apple is currently on a nice run so let’s factor in the 7.3% higher price to be safe on this math… that would make the math as follows…

2.34 Trillion * .073(%) = 2.51 Trillion

2.51 Trillion / AMC total shares (513 million) 

We need a minimum price of $4.894.39 per share to become this valuable and claim the title of MOASS in true fashion…

We make AMC the most valuable company in the world for one day!!!

Now before this becomes any type of argument about the floor…. Yes the floor can easily be $700k a share (it’s July now so the price is up from 500k… sorry not sorry you hedge fucks… stop stalling!!)

Anyone concerned this number isn’t possible is technically wrong… if none of us sell, and they must cover it could go over this amount… that being said, not every share can be sold for that price because once selling starts the price will come down… but just to be clear it takes time for the price to come down… so a super high price will enable as many 🦍‘s as possible to sell for over 100k per share. Resulting in truly life changing money for all!

Just wanted to get some DD posted since I have seen so many asking for it this weekend and haven’t seen one myself yet on exactly what the MOASS really is.

Remember ignore the FUD! BUY and HODL… Keep Calm and Hodl On!!!

oe42nq,False,"So I don't know how to start this.... Ahhh, I fart quite a bit. I'd say a little more than the average person. Not sure if it's related to any medical issues cause I've never had it checked out to be honest, but after today's experience I think I'll go see a doctor... 

Aaannnyway, what I'm about to tell you happened this morning. I'm assuming it was caused by the delicious deep fried chicken and chips I had for dinner last night. 

Queue 8.45am, my regular drop off time for my 3yo to daycare. There's already about 30 kids there at this point and between 10-15 are eating food at the dining tables, I'd say within a 5m2 area. 

I'm walking through the entrance to sign my daughter in and felt a fart coming on, but I'd done one earlier in the car and that was rank as hell so I had to try hold this in. 

Now the front desk lady is a talker, shes dragged on enough that even my fart's seeped back into my body trying to get away from it all. Phew, we're safe... for now anyway. 

The first thing my daughter wants to do is open her lunchbox and see what she's got to eat. While I sit her at the table with all her little devil friends (I'm not much for other people's kids, I can only tolerate so much) I feel that sudden fart peaking it's interest again. Just so you know, I've got good control over them when it comes to volume so I felt confident letting out a silent but violent boy. Blame it on one of those kids right? Easy. 

Now for the chaos. 

This was worse than what I let rip in the car, if I could rank it it'll probably be top 5 worst smells I've dealt. A kid I'm crouched down next to at the table yelled out EWWWWW! and starting coughing then threw up all over his lunchbox. While this was happening one of the teachers was franticly looking around trying to spot another kid and yelling at other teachers to grab a towel and come help. She bolts over to this other kid and tries to run off with him, turns out he has a really bad stomach for seeing other people throw up and the smell of it, but it's too late. While she picks him up and runs off he throws up down her back onto the floor. Because of all the noise there's toodlers crying and teachers trying to defuse the situation thinking one of them has shit their pants. Then the final blow, this toodler comes zooming in to see what the fuss is all about and accidently slips on the puke creating a slip and slide! This kid easily slid 2-3 metres, no worries though, he's just laughing his head off! 

After it's calmed down a bit, they're still searching the rest of the kids for a culprit, I make my way outta there quick and while I'm passing one of the teachers make the comment 'another day in the office huh?'. 


TL;DR when dropping off my daughter at daycare I let out a silent but overly  violent fart. 2 kids threw up and another ran in to see what was going on causing him to create a spew slip N slide.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/oe42nq/tifu_by_causing_chaos_at_my_daughters_childcare/,TIFU by causing chaos at my daughter's childcare centre.,r/tifu,1625478667.0,True,False

oe0tje,False,"My(41 m) daughter(14) and I wanted to go on a trip(Disney world) after this long time of lockdown. I just thought it would be good for her mental health.But, she asked why I don't bring her sister(8) with us. I told her it is just better for her sister to stay with her mom.


Shortly summoned:
I found out that my wife has cheated on me while she was 1 month pregnant. One of her co-workers send me a video where she cheated with multiple man, on a made up working trip. I made sure she got fired, because her company doesn't allow such relationships.
We did a prenatal DNA test, and a DNA test after the birth, court ordered it, because she filed for child support for her Affair child. But I only had to pay child support for my daughter, also we had a prenup agreement, so ex was left without alimony only the half of our shared bank account. 
I was never present on this child's life, also not on the birth certificate. We have shared custody of our child. Ex never wanted to tell my daughter anything, but I told her if she is old enough, I will tell her.In the past, we just told her it is because of our disagreements.
I kept a civil form of interaction with my Ex, only for my daughter.


However, she insisted more and more (she is very protective of her sister), so I decide to tell her the truth(Of course without any details how Ex cheated on me), showed her the DNA test results, but told her it is not the fault of her or her sisters, only her mothers fault. I also told her, that I will love her no matter what, but her sister is  for me a hurtful reminder of the past while she is innocent.

She cried and hugged me, and we both cried. Of course the moral was totally destroyed, we just decide to watch TV  and sit on couch, while she had multiple questions and I answered it. Like, did I have loved her mom, how we have met, what I feel for her now. As she got back to Ex's house, she confronted her mom. That leaded to a call to me(from my daughter) for picking her up, and she lives now with me, and only visits her sister at her grandmas(Ex's mom) place. Ex got in financial trouble, because the child support payments stopped, and accused me of doing this to seek revenge.

But for me, it is my daughter's right to know what happened in the past.

oe38vr,False,"In Disco Elysium, every interaction has hidden threshholds wherein your character's skills are checked and if they meet the threshhold, additional information is given to you. (ex: if you have a ton of points in Encyclopedic Knowledge, anytime someone drops a proper noun, you are likely to gain info about that noun that can help you understand the conversation better.)

I decided to try that in D&D. I took all the player characters and noted their highest skills and stats. Anytime we go into a scene or conversation, I'll check those numbers and give the players extra fluff based on that. It helps me a TON when I'm creating NPCs and it makes the players feel like their choices make a difference in how the world unfolds around them.

So far, it's my favorite tool I've ever used.

 The player with high cha and high deception has been told ""you recognize yourself in this person, you doubt they have often told the truth"" which is a better prompt for insight rolls than the classic ""I want to roll insight to see if they are lying"" from half the players at the table. 

In that example, it also subtly discourages OTHER players from acting on the info. Let the guy who noticed something be the one who acts. 

We've also had the fighter/rogue who is known as a tavern brawler get a ""You've seen people ready to scrap but this guy looks like he knows how to War."" 

It is a nice way to put decorative wallpaper over the rules of the game and make it a bit more immersive. And it engages the players by specifically calling them out and prompting them to act on the information I put out there.

And the best part is that I can more readily nudge them onto the 'right' path by giving them juicy tidbits here and there that catch interest.

oe58y2,False,"Good morning, writingprompts! 

I can’t fully describe how excited I am to finally make this post. Over a year ago, I responded to this prompt:

[After you have died, you meet The Great One who says that you have been wronged in your previous life and, as a result, will be reincarnated with unimaginable powers. You accept the offer and you find yourself reincarnated in a fantasy world full of magic as...a slave?](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/gydeu4/wp_after_you_have_died_you_meet_the_great_one_who/)

The short response grew into a 44-part serial over the next several months. Once the serial was complete, I started editing it offline—the result of which is an 84k word published novel! This is my first, and I owe so much of it to this community. It’s been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember to have a book on my shelf with my name on the spine—and now, that dream is a reality. 

The book is titled *Divinus: Echoes of the Past*, and it’s available on amazon in both ebook and paperback formats, as well as part of Kindle Unlimited. Here’s the blurb from the back of the cover:

> Death is only the beginning.

>Alexander has spent his entire life as a slave. But now, something has changed. He woke one morning with a strange mark on his arm, accompanied by fragmented memories of a previous life. The vast desert now feels somehow unfamiliar, his life foreign. As he struggles to remember who he is--and who he was--he must fight to survive and discover the truth behind his apparent reincarnation. With the help of a strange new power, he aims to free his people and discover the truth.

>His future depends on the secrets of the past--if only he can remember.

And finally, here’s a brief excerpt from the beginning of the book:

*I think I’m dying.*

The sound of medical equipment beeping and whirring fills the room. A machine to my left pumps loud and slow, forcing air through a tube in my throat. It hurt at first—but it’s not so bad now. The pain fades with each passing moment, along with the rest of the world. 

My eyes flick back and forth, eyeing the corners of the room. I’m unsure if the lights are still on; my vision darkens by the second. 

My pulse quickens. The beeping grows faster. My peripheral vision fades to nothing, leaving me with a circle of reality directly in front of me. The beeping fades; sounds of the world lessen, as if turning down the volume on a TV. 

I see movement. A man in blue scrubs—or are they green? Damn, even the color has left the world. He runs past. A woman follows close behind him, but quickly disappears from my narrowing sight. 

The darkness creeps in, narrowing my vision to a pinpoint. No more sound. No more pain. I think they are moving me—doing something, at least—but I can hardly tell. I’m not really there anymore, anyway. 

And now it’s black. 

I take a deep breath, though I feel no air in my lungs. In truth, I feel none of the action at all—but my mind believes I am taking a breath, and the memory of it is relaxing. So I take another. 

A streak of white appears in the distance. A narrow path of light extends, rapidly approaching me. I take a step—or, I remember what it’s like to take a step—and the distance is closed in an instant. I now stand before a large white door, easily three times as tall as me. 

I reach for the knob, but nothing happens. My hand does not appear in front of my eyes—if I even have eyes, that is. How am I to open a door with no hands?

“That door is not for you,” a voice booms in the darkness. 

I spin around, trying to find a sign of life in the void. There’s nothing. As far as my lack of eyes can see, the world is black. All except for the door. 

Once, in the time before this, I could talk. I remember it. I recall the way it felt to move my jaw, flick my tongue. I try to recreate that feeling, to make those noises. I feel nothing from the attempt, but my words float into the space around me anyway. 

“Where am I?” I say. Or think. I’m not really sure. 

“Somewhere you should not be,” the voice booms in reply. Its tone is entirely foreign, almost inhuman. My skin would crawl at the sound—if I still had any. 

“I... I died, didn’t I?” I remember that much, at least. My mind is a field of shadows obscuring a lifetime of experiences, but my death has yet to escape me. The world faded, and then I was here. 

“Yes, but your journey is far from over.”

“What does that mean?”

“It means you have a greater purpose yet to serve,” it says. “You are going to be returned to the world, though it will not be as you left it. Another time, and another reality, unlike anything you remember from your previous life.”

If I have eyes, they blink. “I’ll be reincarnated?”

“In a manner of speaking, yes.”

“Will I live out my life as a child again? What will—”

“Enough,” the voice interrupts. “Time is short. You will have a purpose to serve; a man of great power, and it is up to you to do what is right with what you are given.”

“Great power? Do what’s right? I don’t understand.”

Suddenly, a shadowy figure appears before me, materializing through long thick wisps barely visible against the dark backdrop of the void around me. It wears no face and only vaguely resembles the shape of a person, though much taller than any human I’d seen. If I could gasp, I would. 

“You will see,” it says, reaching out to place a hand on my shoulder. Thick curls of smoke pour over the entity’s fingers, creeping down my bicep. They swirl around my left arm, just past my elbow, and seep into my skin. 

Then they pull.

* * *


In an instant, I feel myself thrust through time and space. An invisible force pulls my body in a hundred different directions, though it doesn’t exactly hurt. Unpleasant is too weak a word for it. All I know is that I want it to stop. 

And then I *feel* again. Not the memory of physical feelings, like in the void. Actual, real existence. My eyes open, adjusting to the darkness, and I see a canvas sheet above me. I recognize it, though it takes a moment to recall why. It’s a tent. My tent. This is where I live. 

My mind fights for an explanation. Disorientation clouds my senses, and I find myself unable to recall any detail of the world aside from what’s in front of me. And what’s in front of me isn’t much—a worn canvas sheet over my head, a bed sitting atop red sand at my feet. 

I sit up in my straw bed, my back aching from the act. A smile flashes on my face. Pain. I’m happy to feel *anything* again. That is, until a white-hot pain flashes across my arm. 

I double over, grasping at my forearm. Agonizing cries pour from my throat, though I reflexively try to muffle them with a hand clasped over my mouth. After a moment, the pain fades. My pulse settles. I lessen my grip on my arm and find the source of the pain: a symbol, seemingly burned into my forearm by an invisible force. The skin is red and blistered and small blue strings worm through the singed flesh. The way they flash and crawl reminds me of electricity. 

The flap to my tent flies open and a woman approaches, worry on her face. She is familiar, though I am not yet sure why. My mind fights to fit a name to her face.

“What’s wrong?” she asks, rushing to my side. She sits on the bed next to me and lays her hand across mine. Pale pink light from the night sky shines through the tent flap behind her.

I look up, meeting her gaze. Her brown hair hangs to her shoulders, matted and dirty. Her face is darkened from sun, and her form is far too thin. But the sight of her tugs at something in my chest. Something... soothing. 

And then the memory comes rushing back. “Kara,” I say, a tear rolling down my cheek. 

She smiles weakly, her exhaustion plain. “That’s me. Don’t forget it.”

Memories continue to fall into place, coming back to me in quick flashes. I remember Kara—or a younger iteration of her—at my side, tending to a wound on my leg. I remember laying next to her late at night, fantasizing about another life. 

And I remember the feeling of blood trickling down my back, pouring from fresh wounds inflicted by the whip of those who enslave us. I remember staring out at the crowd, my eyes meeting hers as the lashes split my flesh. I found strength in her gaze, then. Hope in her determination to survive where I’d all but given up. 

*We are slaves*. The memory sinks into my chest, overpowering the searing pain emanating rom the mark on my arm. 

Why? Why would I be returned to the world of the living for this? A life of pain and suffering. How is this a ‘great power’? I curse under my breath.

“Why were you screaming?” Kara asks, her hand resting on my back. I can feel the rough texture through my shirt as her palm passes over several long scars. 

I turn over my arm and show her the symbol. Her eyes go wide, her actions frozen in an instant. The tent falls silent; only the soft whipping of the breeze hitting the canvas fills the air between us. 

“Do you know what it is?” I ask. 

Her expression hardens. There’s a hint of panic in her eyes—and in the way her lips tighten, the way her nostrils flare. But there’s something else there, as well. Something creeping up from somewhere deeper. Something... hopeful. 

She climbs to her feet with purpose and steps to the entrance of the tent, peering out. Then she turns back around and says, “I think it’s—” she hesitates, peering at the symbol. Her voice falls to a whisper, so low I find myself turning my head to hear her words.

“I don’t want to say, not yet. Not until we know for sure. But if it is...” She trails off for a moment, seemingly lost in thought. 

“Kara?” I say, lifting a brow. 

 She blinks and snaps her attention back to me. “You absolutely cannot show it to anyone.”

“What? Why?” The confusion is plain in my voice. Whatever this mark is—whatever it signifies—I want answers. 

“Because they’ll kill you if they know.”

A ping of fear shoots through me as I recognize the tone in her voice. Her words are not hyperbole. I take a deep, shaky breath, the pain still lingering in my arm. 

“Okay,” I say, nodding. It feels right to trust her.

She returns to my side and rips a long piece of cloth from the already tattered cloth around her waist. 

“Keep it covered,” she says. “Please. I can’t lose you too. Not after...” Her words trail off as she ties the fabric around the mark.

I place a hand on her shoulder. “Alright,” I say. “I’ll keep it hidden. I promise.”

My mind searches for an explanation to her words. She’s lost someone. Recently, from the pain prevalent in her voice. But I can’t remember who. No matter how hard I try, how deep I dig, my mind is still a mess of missing memories and shrouded thoughts. 

“I best get back to my tent,” she says, climbing to her feet. My eyes fall to a long, wide scar along the outside of her forearm. My body reacts without my permission as I watch my hand curl around hers. 

“Stay with me,” I say, meeting her gaze. 

Her stare softens as she pulls her hand away. “It’s not safe yet, you know that. Not so soon after what happened. If they catch us...” 

She turns her head away, letting the silence complete her thought. 

I nod, a sudden exhaustion tugging at my feet. Kara steps through the tent flap and disappears into the night, leaving me alone once more with my fractured thoughts. 

As I lay back against the bed, a part of me hopes to wake up in another world. Or, perhaps, to never wake up at all. Just the thought brings guilt to my mind, but I shrug it off. I did not choose this life. Nor did I choose to be filled with memories of another. 

Maybe the entity that brought me here—that pulled me from that strange void—made a mistake. 

Or maybe I’m being punished.

My biological (12yo) daughter ~ Susan likes to collect and read old children's books. She's become incredible reader. She had problems with reading and learning before and we were advised to encourage her to read and eversince she started reading (which she does regularly) her skills improved. she also reads to her 2yo sister everynight.

I have a (16yo), stepson ~ Levi who can be a hothead sometimes. We don't have a son~dad relationship but I respect him and he respects me though he can act quimean and selfish towards me and his sisters. He'd throw away stuff that belongs to us over small arguments and teases Susan for spending a lot of time to read calling her grandma.

My wife and I discussed his behavior and had conversations and agreed on punishments but Levi'd go to his dad's place whenever he causes troubles then have his dad yell at me for wanting to discuss a suitable punishment. Then Levi comes home days later expecting me to let go of what he did everytime, it's frustrating.

I got a call at work from Susan saying Levi took her entire book collection and threw them in the pool after she refused to lend him and his friends her camera for his trip. My wife helped get them out but they were wet and some were torn. It was horrific because some of those books are hard to get and meant a lot to Susan as a part of her life.
I was so mad at Levi I came home to have a conversation with my wife to decide on a punishment but he already packed a small bag and went to his dad's, I asked my wife how could she let him basically run after doing this and she said he called his dad and he came to pick him up after Susan said that I was coming home to deal with the problem.

I went to his dad's house and he refused to let me see him. I told him how Levi was hiding from consequences and his dad tried to justify why Levi was acting out by blaming me for how me and Susan treat him. He even said he'd get CPS involved if I ever try to punish him because I'm not his dad, I have no right. Adding what Levi did was a reaction to my daughter being mean to him. He told me to leave because Levi won't come home til I promise not to do anything about what he did and put it in writing.

I told him Levi should stay there with him then. He's not to come back til ~he~ get proper punishment.
His dad argued it's his mom's house too and called my wife and she asked to let this go and we'll figure out some way to resolve it but I don't think it's fair for Susan to have her books ruined and Levi getting away with it. They're asking me to let it go but this will only encourage Levi to do worse if I don't deal with it now.
It's been 2 weeks and my in-laws say I was out of line for banning Levi from coming home and are telling me to step back but I refused.

EDIT ~ Levi's dad thinks that because I'm not his bio dad then I have no right to punish him for whatever he does in the house. In the past his dad caused issues when I used to take Levi's electronics (that his dad bouht) as punishment. Then I got talked out of punishing him everytime he did something unacceptable wether to me or his sisters.

I've arranged for family therapy but Levi's dad refused to let him go.

EDIT ~ I'd like to mention that my inlaws said that Levi is willing to apologize to Susan and so this should be enough to get this over with but I kept saying no and for that I'm being considered at fault.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/oe6gq1/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_stepson_return_home/,AITA for refusing to let my stepson return home without punishment after he ruined my daughter's book collection?,r/AmItheAsshole,1625488434.0,True,False

oe7m0p,False,"  In 2014 the Milwaukee Bucks were the worst team in the NBA with a grand total of 15 wins. The two leading scores of this team was a young Brandon Knight who averaged 18

However, looking at this roster, it had 2 familiar faces on it. One was a young 2nd round pick originally traded from Detroit along with Brandon Knight for Brandon Jennings named Khris Middleton who averaged 12 on 54% TS. The other was a 19 year old rookie named Giannis Antetokoumnpo who averaged 7/4throughout 77 games and 23 starts

On the flipside from 2016-2019, the Pheonix Suns never scratched the 25 win mark. These teams were led by a collection of talent such as Eric Bledsoe, TJ Warren, and Kelly Oubre but also a young Devin Booker and eventually Deandre Ayton

Milwaukee is the true definition of a homegrown team and Phoenix isn't far behind Love to see the small town markets winning and overcome the free agency built teams for once. Regardless on who wins hopefully it can encourage future stars to stay and build something with the teams that drafted them like Giannis has

oe74a2,False,"Aghanim's Scepter. An item in Dota 2 with no equivalent in League of Legends. The item's stats are fairly mediocre, pretty much giving a bit of everything so anyone can buy it. However, the thing that makes it worth buying is its passive, which is 100% unique to every single playable character. Upgrading their abilities, or even adding entirely new ones. And recently, Aghanim's Shard was added. A consumable that gives a DIFFERENT unique enhancement. So I thought: what if League of Legends had Aghanim's Scepter and Shard as well?

Most of these are probably not balanced. But man do I wish to play around with these upgrades.

\-

Aatrox - Scepter: Deathbringer Stance empowers Aatrox’s next two attacks as well. The second attack has 100 increased range and roots the target for 0.75 seconds, and the third makes Aatrox leap a short distance to his target and deal bonus damage based on their missing health.

oe605m,False,"So not so fun story, but I've always wanted to share this one. 

I'm not going to drag this out too long, but to get right to the point. My father is very religious to the point we couldn't do a lot of things that would be considered normal. Christmas, dating, ect.

I didn't hate my dad by any means, he taught me a lot. However, he was very abusive. As a black man, he seemed to think the only way to discipline a child was to knock that sense into them. 
He would constantly get angry at minor things and punch my brother in the soft part of his stomach. 

I suppose we both just normalized that abuse. And as I got older, I learned to not take the punches and actually block. The first time I did it, shocked my dad. It was so satisfying not to cry when my dad hit me and just look at him with this blank expression.

Doing this definitely made him more angry as he would try to make me cry. I feel like it gave him some sick satisfaction. 

You'd think all of this would make me hate him? Nope. 
My idiotic self just didn't seem to register how bad this was. I'd try to justify it as him teaching me a lesson. But eventually, the last straw would come. 

So I was 16 at the time, and my father gave me this ultimatum. Continue school or get a job and pay a majority of the bills. He wasn't working at the time and I hated school. While my grades were average to high, I just didn't want to be apart of that environment anymore. 

Our overall bill was about £1300 and I'd have to give £600 of my pay check,with my brother paying the other half. 
I decided to just go with it and look for a job. 

Now, a week into my job search my father started shouting at me. Saying I was taking way too long, (keep in mind, when my brother left school. He gave him over 2 months to find something). He ended up putting me Infront of a computer and made me apply to things all day and night. I ended up going to bed at 6am the next morning. I got so desperate, I applied for McDonald's and within a day got the job... Unfortunately. 
It was one of the worst experiences of my life. A lot of inappropriate touching and horrible acquaintances. 

Anyway, a year into working. A new girl joined the team and as cliché as it sounds. I fell for her instantly. 
I went out of my comfort zone and just decided to flirt with her. Within that day we were dating. It was amazing. 

Obviously, I couldn't tell me dad about this. So we hid it for another year as we dated. Within that time, we ended up having sex. Sex before marriage would be a big no no. 

My father later found out. 
Now this part is pretty invasive. But he had connected to my WhatsApp messages and was reading them on his laptop while I slept. 
I believe he actually opened my phone while I slept, using my thumb recognition. 

I was chewed out the next morning and told to break up with her (which I didn't). Because she was a whore and didn't really love me. 

He then told me to get out of the house and never come back. I will give some context for this. My dad likes to use this line when we're in trouble. He'll make us go outside our flat and then a minute later call us back inside. 

He had never really gotten to that point with me. But my brother experienced it all the time. 
I'd always told him that if our father ever did that to me, I'd just leave. 

So as you can imagine, I left. I walked for hours while my dad was blowing up my phone to come home. If you thought this was because he cared and wanted me to be safe? You'd be wrong. 

He would later send texts telling me not to tell anyone what was happening. It's none of their business and I'm not ruining his reputation.
I wasn't planning on telling people anyway. But the fact he said that shows he only cares for others opinions. 

Because I had left so quickly, I hadn't had time to grab anything. I had a phone and the clothes on my back. 
I had to call my girlfriend for moral support, and after talking. She straight away booked a hotel. I was so thankful. Lucky for me, I was getting paid the next day. So I'd be able to get my money and hopefully rent a place. 

To this day I haven't spoken to my father and I completely blocked him. And while I struggle to pay my rent every month, it's still way better than my situation prior. 

The story does have a happy ending. Remember how I wasn't able to get my stuff? 
Well, my father had gone on holiday ( one of my friends tipped me to this). So my girlfriend and I went back to the house and broke in using a credit card. 

My dad never locked his door, so if you just swiped a card through the door with enough pressure, you could eventually make it turn and get in. 
I was actually struggling to do this, until the neighbor came by and actually did it for me. He was such a good guy! 
I know he just assumed we were locked out, but he really saved my life more than he knows. 

I took everything I wanted, including stuff like the TV. Since it was my money that paid for all of that. 

I can only imagine how shocked my dad was when he came home and found all my stuff gone. He was probably going to sell it to cover the rent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/oe605m/my_father_abused_and_kicked_me_out_of_my_home_so/,My father abused and kicked me out of my home.

oeao7l,False,"So I wanted to write an update after the situation has been resolved.

First things first: I am back on the swim team. For now.

Today  was a really weird and awkward day. First opportunity I went to talk to  my swim coach and explain the whole situation and that I'm not willing  to stay on the wrestling team. He was pretty mad at my dad as well as  the wrestling coach, so he took me to the secretary, explained the whole  thing and asked her to change the list. She was in turn quite mad,  because apparently the whole system is a big mess. I'm not even remotely  the only student who was misplaced.

So  then the secretary called in my homeroom teacher. There was a lot of  accusation. I was just standing there feeling awkward. Really weird to  see three adults being mad at each other.

In  the end, I was basically told by all three to just ignore the whole  thing and that I can just join the swim team if I want to. I figured  that was it, until the end of school day then the wrestling coach had me  come to his office. He gave me a long talk about how disappointed he  is, how he had high hopes for me bla bla bla. I told him I really don't  care and that he was a jerk for just ignoring what I want to do.

To  sum up: Wrestling coach mad at me, homeroom teacher mad at me for  complaining, swimming coach mad at school and my dad is probably gonna  freak out when he hears that I won't wrestle. Oh well...

Lastly  I want to thank all the people that encouraged me to stand up for  myself. You had a lot of good advice. And some really weird advice. And  some really terrible but funny advice. Thank you all!

[I'm so tired of reddit neckbeards whining about scalpers. People buy items, then want to sell it to make money. That's perfectly fine. If you don't wish to buy it at that price, that's perfectly fine. A gaming device or computer component is not a life necessity nor is it something crucially important to survival or ease of life. It is an added luxury, and needs to be understood as such. If people were buying eggs and bread then reselling for 3x the price, that would be something to get upset over. People making money off naive folks who spend some cash on unnecessary, luxury items isn't evil or bad, it's just good business. This sub acts like they are sacrificing children. Of course, desperate people who use gaming as a crutch or who have little hope for the future may disagree, as they no doubt compose a large portion of the sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/oe4zmh/wall_street_journal_are_praising_this_little/h44cchh/)

I was angry I lost my mom, angry my dad was ready to move on in a few months, angry that he wanted me to be happy, angry that my stepbrother had a mom and a dad. Angry that life was moving on without my mom. I wasn't pleasant to be around and honestly, my temper is still there. I'm not angry all the time anymore but I don't think anyone could call me warm in general.

With my kids though? I am very different. My husband likes that I have a fierce side. He doesn't mind that I'm not super soft and gentle in general. But he loves that I am with our kids.

My dad, however, is not happy about it. I think he's disappointed he wasn't right about me being a bad mom because I was never able to find love for my stepbrother or half siblings. That I have never shown that softness with them, and likely never will. He told me it was hard to imagine how I could love some kids but not all. I told him they were my kids, kids I chose to have, kids I had wanted, who were in my heart before they were even born.

The response did not make him happy. And now things are awkward.

I don't know how to proceed from here. My dad and I are already not close. We honestly never were but even less so after everything that happened. He has told me a lot I am like my mom and I don't think he means that in a good way most of the time he says it.

oedey1,False,"So I'm pretty convinced I'm not the ass but wanted to get an outside perspective

Last week I had a work trip to the UK, I was flying from Ottawa to London, since my work was covering it, they already booked my seat in economy and I got the window seat.

When they loaded the plane I was the first to sit in my row, some time passes and this tall blonde girl asks me if she can have the window seat. I really wanted the window seat because I've never been to Europe and I wanted to see all that I can. I told her this and said no thanks, she got defensive and said that she ""needs"" the window seat and she has to work the next day and doesn't want to be jet lagged. I countered and said I work as well and already booked to have this seat (you can pick which seat you want when booking the flight) it went back and fourth for a little, she even asked to see my ticket to make sure I did have the window seat (even though she had the aisle seat).

When she stopped making a fuss she actually put her carry on luggage in the middle seat when the plane was about to take off. I didn't say anything because it doesn't really affect me, but that's pretty bold. Sometime in the flight she ruffles around in her bag and tries to pick it up and it bumps my table infront of me and spills my small cup of water. She literally looks at me and says ""can you keep your water away from me"".

At this point I was in disbelief, so I just some ear buds in and just ignored her. After some hours in she nudges my shoulder to get my attention, I take my buds out and she says that she ""can faintly hear my music, and it's distracting her"" at this point I was pretty done with her and just said I don't care. She didn't like that response and said that she has connections with a lot of people who will ""get me"" if I don't stop annoying her.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing, I said to her I don't know who you think you are"" by then she cut me off and told me she's a big time model with millions of followers and that she knows people all around the world. At this point I was just getting really done with her so I said the ""you're not pretty enough to be acting this way"" and just put my ear buds in the rest of the flight.

Nothing else happened and it was more just uncomfortable, my girlfriend said I should have just given my seat up and avoided all this. But i hate feeling like a doormat to people",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/oedey1/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_window_seat_in_a_plane/,"AITA for not giving up my window seat In a plane then later saying ""you're not pretty enough to act this way""",r/AmItheAsshole,1625510274.0,True,False

oefj4v,False,"Why YSK:

I'm an amateur cook, and I come across a lot of recipes online, either websites or on YouTube, and here are some learnings:

1) Recipes generate clicks. They would reference other similar recipes they've made or say that one of the ingredients which they use was made in another video/ page. While this can be easy sometimes, I can give a particularly bad one - A carbonara recipe needed 2 spoons of a chilli oil, which needed another set of preparations with ingredients like Korean chilli powder which I didn't have for making a whole litre of it. There are many more examples, but just think about how less of an influence any of these will have on the final product and just substitute it. The people behind these websites aren't you, so work with what you have and only make the extra effort if it's worth it.


2) As someone who goes all out when cooking in the sense that I will buy all including optional ingredients especially for recipes I'm trying out for the first time and stick to the recipe, you should really see how useful some of these ingredients are in the future. Taking the previous example, Chilli oil of a particular type can be useful in multiple dishes or it might just sit in your cupboard, only to be used for the initial few spoons or that one recipe made in a blue moon. Save some money and ignore/ substitute it with something you have.

I realize a lot of this is obvious to most people, but the excitement of cooking something new after finding that amazing looking recipe almost always results in buying stuff you're not going to need. I hope this acts as a reminder to help those who are still in that mindset.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/oefj4v/ysk_some_cooking_recipes_online_use_unnecessarily/,"YSK some cooking recipes online use unnecessarily complicated ingredients, you don't need to go all out and buy everything.",r/YouShouldKnow,1625516591.0,True,False

oee082,False,"Lots of posts out there saying tha-this and tha-that with regard to days. Let me clear it up for you by simplifying the language.

**Edit 1:** These are the rules as outlined by the SEC. Whether they adhere to them is another post in itself so take this one as the ""in a perfect world"" scenario.

**Edit 2:** There seems to be some confusion with regard to whether the first 5 days are included in the 13 total - they are. [As outlined by the SEC here](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm), it states:

*On the other hand, a participant must close out a fail to deliver position in a threshold security that has persisted for 13 consecutive settlement days irrespective of the dates of the participant’s trades in that security.*

1. *When does a security become a Fail To Deliver (FTD)?* [T+3](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubstplus3htm.html) (trade date plus three days)
2. *What is a Threshold Security?* \[An\] equity securit\[y\] that ha\[s\] an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency **\[AND\]** total\[s\]10,000 shares or more **\[AND\]** equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding. **Each condition must be met to be considered a Threshold Security.**
3. If upon market open on Day 6 the security still has yet to be delivered, it goes on the list (this 6th day can be seen as Day 1 of the remaining 8 days leading up to 13 days)
4. **8 days (+ the initial 5 days = the aggregate or 13 days) later,** if it is STILL on the list, upon the 14th day ""...the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.""
5. **Aggregate definition:** (*n)* a sum, mass, or assemblage of particulars; a total or gross amount: *the aggregate of all past experience.*
6. *What happens after 13 days?* Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency to take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Generally, a participant’s fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13 consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.
7. *What does Rule 203(b)(3) establish?* The participant must close-out such fails to deliver by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.

Two things to note: **T+35** was amended from Rule 203 (b)(3) in 2006 and fell off under 2007's rule as did the Grandfather Clause.

[(Settlement) Days](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) = Any business day on which deliveries of securities and payments of money may be made through the facilities of a registered clearing agency (in other words, days the market is open)

AMC went on the Threshold List June 25, meaning:

1. June 14 was the ""trade day""
2. June 15-17 the days in the +3 requirement
3. June 18 Day 1 of the first instance of FTD
4. June 25 Day 6 of consecutive FTD and its inclusion on the Threshold List

I'm just a retarded ape, but based on this info and my understanding, if AMC is still on the list upon market open July 8 (Day 14), brokers-dealers are required to purchase some 32.5 million shares. (I'm basing this on the figures that have already been established: 2.5 million shares a day x 13).

Just my .02.

**Edit:** Great question. At minimum, 2.5m shares got us on the list but it could very well be that it's the same 2.5m shares lingering for 13 days. However, given hedgies are still trading, it's safe to assume they are at least adding to this figure daily though it might not be 2.5m AGGREGATED.

At the very minimum, 2.5m shares would be obligated to be closed by July 8 per the SEC rules

**Edit:** Added the definition for aggregate because people STILL don't get it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/oee082/threshold_securities_facts_no_dates_but_its/,Threshold Securities Facts (No Dates But It's Sooner Than You Think),r/amcstock,1625512016.0,True,False

oefzas,False,"Elders of the Brotherhood, hear my plea. I love Fallout, just like you and many others here. But this sub is getting repetitive. It’s mostly new fans coming in and making the same old observations and arguments. Not to mention the ever popular “Should I play Fallout X or Y” post. While we’re still pretty big, I’ve seen this sub’s numbers dwindle over the years. I feel like this has been an ongoing trend since the decline of Fallout 76.

I’ve been around long enough to remember the state of this sub before Fallout 4, and for some reason that game changed a lot of the rules. Why were memes even banned in the first place? Like I’ve said before, they’re funny and start conversation on their own. I know we’re supposed to be a discussion subreddit, but we don’t need only text posts for that. 

Plus, the few dedicated Fallout meme subs don’t have large enough subscriber bases to support themselves. Most Fallout fans would expect to find that kind of content here. Subs with low subscriber counts aren’t seen as legitimately as bigger ones, but then when people come to the biggest Fallout sub, it’s just a bunch of boring plain text of Fallout nerds arguing which is better? Dogmeat 1 or Dogmeat 2?

I’m just making a suggestion, as I can see the state of this sub going nowhere but downhill until a new game comes out. And who knows how long that will be? If you must, put it to a vote among the subscribers. I would just like to bring more life to this community and make it a more fun place in general. Fallout is supposed to be somewhat lighthearted and funny anyway, right?

oeg7zt,False,"My office has got a front door which faces onto the ‘bosses’ car park and a door at the back which is onto the normal car park. It’s a big building, it takes 10 minutes to walk round the outside to get to the front door which is a pain in the arse if it is raining, you’ve got your arms full etc. 

The door at the back is the kind with a push bar on it that you can only open from the outside. Nowhere on the door does it say it is a fire door. And as far as I am aware nowhere does it say that you can’t leave a fire door open. We work on a secure site so controlling access to the building isn’t an issue, therefore 80% of the people I work with (who park in the back car park) leave the door open so that other people can get in that way. 

One of the department heads (who isn’t that senior, but is senior enough to park in the front car park) has got this real bee in his bonnet about the back door being open because it is a ‘fire door’ (it isn’t). I am talking 3 internal memos a week, printed signs stuck up all over the place, every AOB at the end of a meeting he brings it up. Bloody annoying. He is the only person who cares about it. 

Last week they were resurfacing the front car park. All managers parked in the back and used the back door. On Wednesday the weather was horrendous; howling wind, torrential rain etc. Walking past the back door (which was open) I saw fire door manager pull up in the back car park. Clearly he doesn’t want the back door open, so I shut it. 

Roll on 15 minutes and he is in his office looking like he swam to work trying to get IT support to come and fix his laptop because he fell over in a puddle and dropped his bag (with laptop in it).

oecfes,True,"I (28F) live in a 1 bedroom apartment that has the front porch area just outside the bedroom window. The porch light doesn’t have a switch; the complex automatically turns them on when it gets dark, so I almost always have blackout curtains drawn. But today I had the day off work and wanted some sunlight so that I wouldn’t sleep all day, so I opened the curtain. 

Anyways, here I am lying in bed like “I know what’ll wake me up!” And I break up the ole vibrator. So a little time goes by and I’m doing my thing, watching a video and going to town, when suddenly my dog barks and I look up just in time to see this guy around my age standing there just outside my window taking a picture. We make eye contact. He’s not bad looking, but I’m just in shock and he kind of backs away quickly... I sit up to see where he’s off too, still freaking out. What a perv, right?! Well, then I realize he’s getting into an Amazon truck... driving away... oh jeez, he was just dropping off a package and had to take a picture for evidence. The porch is a confined area and there’s literally no other angle he could have taken that from. Oh no. There isn’t a glare on the window or anything that could have saved me either. I don’t know what Amazon does with the photos of delivered packages, but this one is going to have a little extra evidence in the background. 

TL;DR I looked up while using my vibrator to see a man outside my window taking a picture on the porch. Turns out it was the Amazon delivery guy just trying to do his job and I was in the background.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/oecfes/tifu_by_opening_my_blackout_curtains/,TIFU by opening my blackout curtains,r/tifu,1625507256.0,True,False
